**YPSH - Your route of Programming is Starting from Here**

PyYPSH is one of the official implementations of the YPSH programming language.

It is being developed by DiamondGotCat (hereafter referred to as the creator) alone and is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

## About the YPSH Language
The creation of the YPSH language was prompted by a problem the creator was struggling with.

The creator, who uses Python, Swift, PHP, etc. (primarily Python), noticed that certain language-specific issues, such as Python's indentation and PHP's `;`, were inherently inconvenient, leading him to wonder, "Isn't it possible to combine the best parts of various languages?"

This is why PyYPSH has such strong integration with the Python interpreter.
Python has a large number of libraries, so it's only natural that you'd want to use them in your own language.

The PyYPSH interpreter offers features that are only possible because it's based on Python, such as direct import of Python libraries.

## About Building
PyYPSH is built using DGC-AutoBuild, a GitHub Action. It automatically starts building immediately after a release is published.

Pre-releases are automatically applied to the `beta` channel, and regular releases are automatically applied to the `stable` channel.

## About Contributions
YPSH is under active development on GitHub.

If you need a feature or fix, please open an issue or make your own changes and submit a pull request.

Your contributions are welcome.
